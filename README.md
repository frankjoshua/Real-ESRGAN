# Real-ESRGAN
PyTorch implementation of a Real-ESRGAN model trained on custom dataset. This model shows better results on faces compared to the original version. It is also easier to integrate this model into your projects.

> This is a forked version that has been patched to work with newer versions of Hugging Face Hub (v0.34.3+). The original deprecated `cached_download` API has been replaced with the modern `hf_hub_download` API.

> This is not an official implementation. We partially use code from the [original repository](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN)

Real-ESRGAN is an upgraded [ESRGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00219) trained with pure synthetic data is capable of enhancing details while removing annoying artifacts for common real-world images.

### Installation

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/frankjoshua/Real-ESRGAN.git
```

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch >= 1.7
- huggingface-hub >= 0.34.3 (patched for compatibility)

### Usage

---

Basic usage:

```python
import torch
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np
from RealESRGAN import RealESRGAN

device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')

model = RealESRGAN(device, scale=4)
model.load_weights('weights/RealESRGAN_x4.pth', download=True)

path_to_image = 'inputs/lr_image.png'
image = Image.open(path_to_image).convert('RGB')

sr_image = model.predict(image)

sr_image.save('results/sr_image.png')
```
